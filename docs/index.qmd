## Why cloud computing?

- Running analyses in parallel 
  + (where more cores are good!)   

- Running analyses with data that are too big for your personal computer 
  + (where more RAM is good!)  
  
- Freeing up your personal computer to do other things  

## Google virtual machines (VM) using Compute Engine  

- Uses Google's [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute), part of the Google Cloud ecosystem of produts  

- Spin up virtual machines (VMs) while specifying the number of cores you want and how much RAM you want  

  + Up to 224 cores and 896 GB RAM!

- They cost money to use, but [pricing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing) is straightforward and on a per-hour basis  

  + 16 cores and 64 GB of RAM costs \$0.54/hour
  + 32 cores and 128 GB of RAM costs \$1.08/hour
  + 224 cores and 896 GB RAM costs \$7.57/hour

## Google virtual machines (VM) using Compute Engine  

- Three ways to spin up VMs: 
  + [Google's online GUI](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute)  
  + [The terminal](https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/gce-i.html)  
  + [googleComputeEngineR](https://cloudyr.github.io/googleComputeEngineR/) R package
  
- Can install R Studio, allowing you to run R Studio interactively through your web browser

## UCSB servers

## Working with data on Google Drive

- Manually move data 
- [googledrive](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/index.html) R package to read/write data from the emLab Team Drive
- Mount Goolge Drive as disk (*not currently working on Goolge Compute Engine*)

## Comparing the two approaches

- Cost
- Computing power
- Handling data
- Working with data on Google Drive
- Ease of use

## Our recommendation (*for most applications*)

Google VMs using Compute Engine

## Live demo time!

- `r/google_compute_engine_demo.R`

- `r/ucsb_server_demo.R`

## Discussion

- What do folks think of our recommendation to generally use Google VMs with Compute Engine?
- Should we update the [emLab SOP](https://emlab-ucsb.github.io/SOP/5-high-performance-computing.html) and make this more formal?
- We might eventually think about a standard emLab VM Docker image that includes our commonly used packages
- And maybe even an emLab R package to help automate some of this?
- Depending on how many people and how intensively we are going to be using this, we may need to think about how to better monitor and manage billing across projects
