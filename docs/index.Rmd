## Why cloud computing?

- Running analyses in parallel 
  + (where more cores are good!)   

- Running analyses with data that are too big for your personal computer 
  + (where more RAM is good!)  
  
- Freeing up your personal computer to do other things  

## Google virtual machines (VM) using Compute Engine  

- Uses Google's [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute), part of the Google Cloud ecosystem of produts  

- Spin up virtual machines (VMs) while specifying the number of cores you want and how much RAM you want  

  + Up to 224 cores and 896 GB RAM!

- They cost money to use, but [pricing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing) is straightforward and on a per-hour basis  

  + For example, 16 cores and 64 GB of RAM costs \$0.54/hour
  + 32 cores and 128 GB of RAM costs \$1.08/hour
  + 224 cores and 896 GB RAM costs \$7.57/hour

## Google virtual machines (VM) using Compute Engine  

- Three ways to spin up VMs: 
  + [Google's online GUI](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute)  
  + [The terminal](https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/gce-i.html)  
  + [googleComputeEngineR](https://cloudyr.github.io/googleComputeEngineR/) R package
